# Pairs-Trading-Model
Statistical pairs trading model which builds market neutral long/short spreads using OLS hedge ratios on log prices and residual mean reversion. Filters and ranks pairs via reversion metrics and coefficient checks, optimises entry/exit bands with a regularised profit objective, then backtests with stops and risk adjusted performance metrics.
